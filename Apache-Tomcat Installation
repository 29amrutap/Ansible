                                   Apache-Tomcat Installation 

Step 1:  Download the apache-tomcat zip file under /home/openplatform, from the https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi site.

Step 2: Navigate to /opt as root user and unzip the source file like
# sudo bash && cd /opt && unzip /apache-tomcat-8.5.30.zip

Step 3: Now go to the following directory.
# cd /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.30/bin

Step 4: Now change the permissions to executable permissions to root like.
# chmod –R 700 /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-8.5.30/bin/*.sh

Step 5: Now change the default users in tomcat configuration file.
Go to the tomcat-users.xml file and search for rolename and username and change the default users and roles according to requirement.
vi /opt/tomcat-8.5.5/conf/tomcat-users.xml
Here you can change the role name and username
<role rolename="tomcat"/>
  <role rolename="role1"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat"/>
  <user username="both" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat,role1"/>
  <user username="role1" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="role1"/>

Step 6:  Now create the file tomcat under the init.d like
# vi /etc/init.d/tomcat

Add the below init script in the above file, to allow stop and start of service:
#!/bin/sh
# Tomcat application container
# chkconfig: 234 20 80

Step 7: To start service:
Use the following command to stop the tomcat like
# /etc/init.d/tomcat stop

Step 8: To start service:
Use the following command to start the tomcat like
# /etc/init.d/tomcat start

Step 9: Check the tomcat is running or not like
# /etc/init.d/tomcat status
By this output you will get know like tomcat is running or not.
If service is running then you will see the out put like..
“Tomcat is running with pid: 1234”

Step 10: Tail tomcat logs (Catalina.out) to check if there are any startup errors.
Fix them and restart tomcat service as needed.
